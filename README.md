# spoo-f-etch
CustomFetch is a Bash installer that helps you spoof your Neofetch output. Pick a distro and customize system info like hostname, kernel, uptime, packages, CPU, GPU, and more. It overwrites your Neofetch config to show your chosen fake details whenever you run neofetch. No Python required and easy to use on Debian-based Linux.
